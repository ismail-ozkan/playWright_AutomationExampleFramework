CODE GENERATE:
PS C:\PlayWright_Automation> npx playwright codegen


00:46  Step 1 - Create a new file under test folder
02:15  Step 2 - Add module ‘playwright/test’

const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

05:35  Example how to add and import modules

12:48  Playwright Test provides a test function to declare tests and expect function to write assertions
13:10  Step 3 - Create a test block - test(title, testFunction)

test('My First Test',  async ({page}) =＞ {
    await page.goto('https://google.com');
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Google');
})
17:20
The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise
The keyword await before a function makes the function wait for a promise
